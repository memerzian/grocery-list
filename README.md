# grocery-list
## Info
This is a basic application that allows for the creation of a grocery list and then sending it to a google task list

## Why
My wife and wanted a quick way to create our grocery list instead of always going through recipe books

## How
1) Choose meals that you want to make for the week
2) Edit list based on ingredients that you already own or add ones not included in the recipes
3) Export list to a google task list
